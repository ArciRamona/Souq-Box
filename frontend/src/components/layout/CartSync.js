export default CartSync;

// The part that actually fixed it was:

// 	 Switching from user.id to user._id

// Since your backend (probably MongoDB) returns the user’s ID as _id, and all your cart-saving/loading logic was using user.id, there was a mismatch — meaning:
// 	•	It was saving to cartItems_undefined
// 	•	And trying to load from cartItems_undefined

// Once you used user?._id consistently in both CartSync and CartLoader, it correctly:
// 	•	📝 Saved to cartItems_6769abc123 after add-to-cart
// 	•	📥 Loaded from the same key when the same user logged in
